Combined with knowledge of the region's industrial activities and construction boom, a clear picture of environmental challenges and potential mitigation strategies emerges.\n\n**Key Environmental Problems:**\n\n* **Air Quality:**  The AQI data for Vijayawada (closest available data) indicates fluctuating air quality, with periods of \"Moderate,\" \"Poor,\" \"Very Poor,\" and even \"Severe\" pollution levels throughout the year.  April stands out with the highest number of \"Severe\" days, suggesting a critical pollution period likely due to increased industrial activity, construction dust, and potentially meteorological factors like pre-monsoon dust storms.\n\n* **Water Quality:** The linked report highlights potential water quality concerns in Amaravati.  Given the industrial presence (textiles, steel, plastics, batteries) and agricultural runoff, there is a risk of heavy metal contamination, chemical pollution, and eutrophication in the Krishna River and groundwater.  The report stresses the need for preliminary treatment before water use, indicating that contamination is a tangible issue.\n\n* **Soil Quality:** While the report generally finds soil quality within acceptable limits,  long-term industrial discharge and intensive agriculture (especially if fertilizers and pesticides are not managed properly) can lead to soil degradation, impacting fertility and crop yields.\n\n**Recommended Mitigation Steps:**\n\n1. **Industrial Pollution Control:**\n    * **Stricter Emission Standards:** Enforce stringent emission limits for all factories, particularly those producing steel, textiles, plastics, and battery components, focusing on particulate matter, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds.\n    * **Regular Monitoring and Inspections:** Implement a robust environmental audit system with frequent inspections and publicly accessible reports to ensure compliance.\n    * **Wastewater Treatment:** Mandate state-of-the-art wastewater treatment plants for all industries before discharge into the Krishna River, ensuring compliance with strict effluent standards.\n    * **Promote Cleaner Technologies:** Encourage industries to adopt cleaner production technologies and best management practices to minimize pollution at the source.\n\n2. **Construction Site Management:**\n    * **Dust Suppression Measures:** Enforce dust control measures at all construction sites, including water sprinkling, covering exposed materials, and using barriers.\n    * **Construction Waste Management:** Implement proper handling, sorting, and disposal of construction waste to prevent pollution of land and water resources.\n\n3. **Sustainable Agriculture:**\n    * **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Promote IPM strategies to reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides, minimizing their impact on soil and water quality.\n    * **Efficient Fertilizer Use:** Encourage farmers to adopt balanced fertilizer use based on soil testing and crop requirements, minimizing nutrient runoff.\n    * **Organic Farming:** Support the transition to organic farming practices, improving soil health and reducing chemical pollution.\n\n4. **River and Groundwater Protection:**\n    * **Riparian Buffer Zones:** Establish and maintain riparian buffer zones along the Krishna River to filter pollutants from agricultural runoff and prevent erosion.\n    * **Groundwater Recharge:** Implement rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge projects to improve water availability and dilute pollutants.\n    * **Water Quality Monitoring:** Establish a comprehensive water quality monitoring network for the Krishna River and groundwater, with regular testing for pollutants.\n\n5. **Public Awareness and Participation:**\n    * **Environmental Education:** Conduct public awareness campaigns on environmental issues, promoting responsible waste management, water conservation, and sustainable practices.\n    * **Community Involvement:** Engage local communities in environmental monitoring and restoration activities, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility.\n\n\n**Agricultural Schedule and Recommended Crops:**\n\nGiven Amaravati's climate and soil conditions, the following crop schedule and recommendations are suggested (noting this requires further site-specific assessment):\n\n* **Kharif (Monsoon - June-October):** Rice, maize, sorghum, groundnut, cotton.\n* **Rabi (Winter - October-March):** Wheat, chickpeas, lentils, mustard, vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, onions, brinjal).\n* **Summer (March-June):** Vegetables (e.g., cucumber, gourds), sunflowers, green gram.\n\n**Specific Recommendations:**\n\n* **Drought-resistant crops:**  Consider drought-resistant varieties of rice, maize, and pulses to adapt to potential water scarcity.\n* **Crop diversification:** Encourage farmers to diversify their crops to improve soil health, reduce pest risks, and enhance income security.\n* **Promote high-value crops:** Explore opportunities for cultivating high-value crops like fruits and vegetables for local markets, increasing farmer incomes.\n\nIt is essential to prioritize sustainable practices in all sectors – industry, construction, and agriculture – to address the environmental challenges and protect the valuable resources of Amaravati. By implementing the proposed mitigation measures and promoting sustainable agriculture, it is possible to build a more environmentally sound and resilient future for the city and its inhabitants. This plan provides a starting point, but further detailed research, data collection, and stakeholder consultation are crucial for its successful implementation and adaptation to the specific needs of Amaravati.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat_session.send_message(\"what is the data u needed to further analysis and plans\",safety_settings={\n            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,\n            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,\n            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,\n            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT:HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE\n        })  ","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-13T15:52:52.180719Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-13T15:52:52.181121Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-13T15:54:04.139261Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-13T15:52:52.181085Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-13T15:54:04.138224Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-13T15:55:42.721396Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-13T15:55:42.721911Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-13T15:55:42.728614Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-13T15:55:42.721865Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-13T15:55:42.727370Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"To perform a more thorough environmental analysis and develop more targeted and effective plans for Amaravati, I would need the following data:\n\n**More Granular Data:**\n\n* **Specific AQI data for Amaravati:** The current AQI data is for Vijayawada.

This includes mapping of sensitive habitats and endangered species.\n* **Socioeconomic data:** Information on population demographics, health indicators, economic activities, and community perceptions of environmental issues is important for developing socially equitable and sustainable environmental management plans.\n\n\n\n**Advanced Data and Modeling:**\n\n* **Emission inventories:** Developing detailed emission inventories for various sources (industries, vehicles, agriculture) will help pinpoint pollution hotspots and quantify the contribution of different sectors.\n* **Air quality modeling:** Employing air quality models can help predict pollution dispersion patterns under different scenarios and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures.\n* **Hydrological modeling:** Using hydrological models can simulate water flow and pollution transport in the Krishna River and groundwater, helping optimize water management strategies.\n* **Carrying capacity studies:** Evaluating the carrying capacity of the region in terms of water resources, air quality, and land use will help guide sustainable development and prevent exceeding ecological limits.\n\n\n\n**Active Projects and Real-time Data:**\n\nIdeally, access to information on current environmental initiatives, ongoing monitoring programs, and real-time data from sensors deployed in Amaravati would greatly enhance the analysis and planning process.  This will help understand the current state of the environment and evaluate the effectiveness of existing initiatives.\n\n\n\nBy incorporating this expanded data set, the analysis can move beyond identifying general problems to develop more precise, location-specific recommendations for mitigating environmental risks, promoting sustainable development, and building a healthy and resilient Amaravati.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat_session.send_message([\"i think the documents i linked to you consists of the thinks you mentioned the report i taggeed you give the soil water and socio economic data\",soil],safety_settings={\n            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,\n            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,\n            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,\n            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT:HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE\n        })  ","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-13T15:56:49.441262Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-13T15:56:49.441853Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-13T15:58:01.771318Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-13T15:56:49.441808Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-13T15:58:01.770075Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response.text","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-13T15:58:01.773216Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-13T15:58:01.773600Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-13T15:58:01.782473Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-13T15:58:01.773560Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-13T15:58:01.781131Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":11,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"You are right, the linked report *does* contain valuable information on soil and water characteristics in the Amaravati region. My apologies for overlooking the level of detail present.  The report provides physicochemical analysis data for soil and water samples from 22 locations, including pH, alkalinity, hardness, total solids, and other key parameters. It also offers insights into the socioeconomic context by describing the study area, mentioning population (2011 census data) and literacy rates, and highlighting the importance of groundwater for the region.\\n\\nHowever, the data, while helpful, is still limited in scope and time.  My previous request for more data remains relevant for several reasons:\\n\\n* **Limited Spatial Coverage:** The 22 sample locations may not be fully representative of the diverse environmental conditions across the entire Amaravati capital region. A larger and more strategically distributed sampling network is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.\\n* **Outdated Data (2018):** Environmental conditions can change significantly over time. The data from 2018 may not accurately reflect the current situation, especially given the rapid pace of development and industrial growth in Amaravati. More recent data is essential.\\n* **Lack of Real-Time Monitoring:** The report presents a snapshot of historical data. Real-time monitoring of air and water quality is essential for detecting pollution events, identifying trends, and taking timely corrective actions.\\n* **Limited Pollutant Coverage:** The water quality analysis might not cover the full spectrum of potential pollutants relevant to Amaravati's industrial context (e.g., specific heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals).  More comprehensive pollutant testing is necessary.\\n* **Missing Details for Advanced Analysis:**  Data for advanced modeling (emission inventories, hydrological data, etc.) as well as crucial details on industrial processes and waste generation are absent from the report. This information is necessary for predictive modeling and effective mitigation planning.\\n* **Limited Socioeconomic Detail:** While the report touches upon population, more extensive socioeconomic data (health indicators, economic activities, community perceptions of environmental issues) is needed for designing socially equitable and sustainable environmental management plans.  The 2011 census data is now quite outdated, given India's population dynamics.\\n\\nIn summary, while the linked report provides a foundation, updating and supplementing it with the data points mentioned in my previous response is crucial for developing a more accurate, current, and comprehensive environmental management plan for Amaravati. This will enable a more robust assessment of risks, more effective mitigation strategies, and a more sustainable future for the capital region.\\n\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Web scraping of air quality data of amaravati","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install firecrawl-py","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-13T09:31:01.663287Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-13T09:31:01.663866Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-13T09:31:18.297170Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-13T09:31:01.663818Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-13T09:31:18.295719Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"url = 'https://aqicn.org/city/india/amaravati/secretariat/'\nimport firecrawl\nimport getpass\n\nFIRECRAWL_API_KEY = getpass.getpass(\"Mendable API Key: \")\n\ndef scrape_firecrawl(url: str):\n    app = firecrawl.FirecrawlApp(api_key=FIRECRAWL_API_KEY)\n    scraped_data = app.scrape_url(url)[\"markdown\"]\n    return scraped_data\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-13T09:32:29.304234Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-13T09:32:29.304832Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-13T09:32:44.735504Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-13T09:32:29.304779Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-13T09:32:44.734039Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"air =\"\"\"|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [**Secretariat, Amaravati** AQI](https://aqicn.org/city/india/amaravati/secretariat/ \"Secretariat, Amaravati\"): Secretariat, Amaravati Real-time Air Quality Index (AQI). | ![](https://aqicn.org/images/icons/p/mapb2.png) | ![](<Base64-Image-Removed>) | [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)](https://aqicn.org/city/india/amaravati/secretariat/m/ \"view in full screen\") |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 65 | Moderate<br>Updated on Wed. 15:00<br>temperature: **27** °C |\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| current | past 2 days | min | max |\n| PM2.5 AQI | 65 | ![Secretariat, Amaravati, India PM25 (fine particulate matter)  measured by CPCB - India Central Pollution Control Board.
