With some refinements, this setup could be applied to other document-intensive applications.\r\n\r\nWhile testing the Gemini model with documents, the model demonstrated strong capabilities in processing text-based content but showed limitations in analyzing complex elements, such as graphs. It struggled to interpret graph data accurately and retrieve relevant answers for graph-based questions. This indicates that while Gemini is effective for text extraction and structured information retrieval, additional enhancements or specialized models may be required for comprehensive analysis of graphical content within documents.\r\n","metadata":{}}]}
